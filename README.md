# Google-Protocol-buffers
Implementation of Student Addressbook using Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data

Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages. 

Protocol buffers support many languages but I have implemented the code in C++. This implementation was a part of my learning curve for my job at RackWare Inc.
